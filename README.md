Important concepts: Data Binding, Method Chaining, ...


Data Binding
------------

If you're experienced with looping through data sets, and writing code to process that data directly, D3's Data Binding may be a little tricky to wrap your brain around. You may find that you're looking for the loop. But you have to let go of the loop, and let data binding run the loop for you. Yeah, it's a little weird.



Method Chaining
---------------

This one is easier. Basically, an object's method returns a modified version of the object itself?
